## Feature Breakdown

### User Management

- **Endpoints:** `/users/`, `/users/{user_id}/`  
- **Features:** Register, authenticate, and manage user profiles.

### Property Management

- **Endpoints:** `/properties/`, `/properties/{property_id}/`  
- **Features:** Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.

### Booking System

- **Endpoints:** `/bookings/`, `/bookings/{booking_id}/`  
- **Features:** Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.

## API Security

Ensuring the security of our API is a top priority. The following measures are implemented to protect user data, maintain system integrity, and prevent unauthorized access.

### Key Security Measures

| Security Measure | Description | Purpose |
|------------------|-------------|----------|
| **Authentication** | All API endpoints require valid authentication tokens (e.g., JWT or OAuth 2.0). | Ensures that only verified users and systems can access the API. |
| **Authorization** | Role-based access control (RBAC) defines what actions users can perform. | Prevents unauthorized users from accessing restricted resources. |
| **Rate Limiting** | Limits the number of requests per user/IP in a given time period. | Protects against abuse, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and API overload. |
| **Input Validation & Sanitization** | All incoming data is validated and sanitized before processing. | Prevents injection attacks and data corruption. |
| **Encryption (HTTPS & Data-at-Rest)** | All communication occurs over HTTPS; sensitive data is encrypted in storage. | Protects user credentials and sensitive information from interception. |
| **Logging & Monitoring** | API activity is logged and monitored for suspicious behavior. | Enables early detection of potential security threats. |

---

### ðŸ§  Why Security Is Crucial

- **Protecting User Data:**  
  Sensitive information such as personal details, emails, and passwords must be protected from unauthorized access and data breaches.

- **Securing Payments:**  
  If financial transactions are involved, proper encryption and authentication prevent fraud and ensure trust between users and the system.

- **Maintaining System Integrity:**  
  Security controls like rate limiting and input validation prevent malicious users from exploiting vulnerabilities or overloading the system.

- **Compliance with Regulations:**  
  Following best security practices helps meet data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), reducing legal and reputational risks.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is a CI/CD Pipeline?

A **CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)** pipeline automates the process of integrating code changes, testing, and deploying applications. It ensures that new features or bug fixes are continuously tested and delivered to production with minimal manual intervention.

### Why Itâ€™s Important

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline helps maintain code quality, speed up development, and reduce human error. Key benefits include:

- **Faster Development Cycles:** Automates building, testing, and deployment processes.
- **Early Bug Detection:** Continuous testing helps identify issues before they reach production.
- **Consistent Deployments:** Ensures the same deployment process is used across all environments.
- **Improved Collaboration:** Allows developers to integrate their work frequently and confidently.
- **Higher Reliability:** Reduces downtime and deployment-related issues.

### Tools Commonly Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **GitHub Actions** | Automates CI/CD workflows directly within GitHub. |
| **Docker** | Packages applications into containers for consistent deployment. |
| **Jenkins** | Open-source automation server for managing CI/CD pipelines. |
| **CircleCI** | Cloud-based CI/CD service for automating builds and tests. |
| **Kubernetes** | Orchestrates containerized applications for scalable deployment. |
